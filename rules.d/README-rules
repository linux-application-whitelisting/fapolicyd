This group of rules are meant to be used with the fagenrules program.
The fagenrules program expects rules to be located in /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/
The rules will get processed in a specific order based on their natural
sort order. To make things easier to use, the files in this directory are
organized into groups with the following meanings:

10 - macros
20 - patterns
30 - loop holes
40 - ELF rules
50 - user/group access rules
60 - application access rules
70 - language rules
80 - trusted execute
90 - general open access to documents

that should be thought out and individual files copied to
/etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/

Once you have the rules in the rules.d directory, you can load them by running
fagenrules --load

You can reconstruct the old policy files by including the following:

fapolicyd.rules.known-libs

95-allow-open.rules
