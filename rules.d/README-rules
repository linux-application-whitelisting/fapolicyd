This group of rules are meant to be used with the fagenrules program.
The fagenrules program expects rules to be located in /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/
The rules will get processed in a specific order based on their natural
sort order. To make things easier to use, the files in this directory are
organized into groups with the following meanings:

10 - Kernel and auditctl configuration
20 - Rules that could match general rules but we want a different match
30 - Main rules
40 - Optional rules
50 - Server Specific rules
70 - System local rules
90 - Finalize (immutable)

that should be thought out and individual files copied to
/etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/

Once you have the rules in the rules.d directory, you can load them by running
fagenrules --load
