# This policy is designed to be as safe as possible. It's intended to
# block execution via the runtime linker and only allow execution by
# trusted ELF and python programs. It also enforces that only trusted
# libraries are allowed. It blocks execution by other languages and
# must be explicitly enabled.
#
# If you wish to modify the list, whitelisting works by first stating
# what is allowed. Then you list what is denied. The rules end with an allow
# anything to prevent unintended blockage to things like media files,
# documents, or anything else applications access that is not a computer
# language.
