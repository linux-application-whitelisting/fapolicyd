# Overview of the default fapolicyd-filter.conf
#
# Decision flow
#   1.  Rules are read top-to-bottom.  Leading “+” means the path is
#       considered essential and will be added to the trust database;
#       leading “-” means the path is skipped.
#   2.  Indentation creates a parent-child relationship.  A child rule
#       refines the decision of its parent.  Think “allow everything
#       under /usr/, then deny one sub-tree, then allow one file type
#       back in”, etc.
#   3.  If no rule matches at the end of the scan, the parent’s decision
#       stands; the very last top-level rule is therefore the catch-all.
#
# What the shipped rules do
#   • Start with “+ /”             → everything allowed by default.
#   • Deny /usr/include/ entirely.                      (- usr/include/)
#   • Deny /usr/share/ but re-allow developer artefacts:
#         *.py  *.pl  etc
#   • Deny /usr/src/kernel*/       except:
#         */scripts/*   and   */tools/objtool/*
#   • Deny html, md, conf, and other non-executable files
#
# For full syntax see:  man 5 fapolicyd-filter.conf
