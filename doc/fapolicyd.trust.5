.SH NAME
fapolicyd.trust \- fapolicyd's file of trust
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.trust
contains list of trusted files/binaries for the application whitelisting daemon. You may add comments to the file by starting the line with a '#' character.
Each line has to contain three columns and space is a valid separator. The first column contains full path to the file, the second is size of the file in bytes
and the third is valid sha256 hash.
.sp
The directory \fI/etc/fapolicyd/trust\&.d\fR can be used to store multiple trust files\&.
This way a privileged user can split the trust database into multiple files and manage them separately through \fBfapolicyd\-cli\fR\&.
Functionally, the fapolicy daemon will behave the same way as if the whole trust database has been defined inside \fBfapolicyd\&.trust\fR file\&.
Syntax and semantics of trust files inside \fBtrust\&.d\fR directory are the same as for \fBfapolicyd\&.trust\fR file (described above)\&.
Trust files can either be created manually inside \fBtrust\&.d\fR directory or via \fBfapolicyd\-cli\fR\& (the latter option is recommended).
